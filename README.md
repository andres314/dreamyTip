DreamyTip: a simple and lovely jQuery tooltip

The usage is similar to any Pluing jQuery.
The only settings in the HTML is the title attribute
in the tag that will have the tooltip, which will
contain the text to display. 
You should include this file, dreamytip.css, dreamytip.png and the 
jquery.ba-outside-events.min.js plugin by Ben Alman for the events
outside the tooltip(for more info 
about this plugin check this site http://bit.ly/gCHiHT).
